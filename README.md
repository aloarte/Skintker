<br>
Skintker its an app for Android devices developed to help people with skin issues in the process of
tracking which elements of their daily routine may cause those issues. The user can save a log every
day and track every past log easily. Those logs can be extracted into an external CSV in order to
analyze them with an external tool.

The app requires a Google authentication. This is used to bind in Firebase the user and its data in
order to preserve the tracked logs if the user uninstall the app or clear the data.
